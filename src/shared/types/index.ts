// Instead of relying on auto-generated types from $props(),
// try to keep explicit and strict types by importing and using
// generated types (e.g. LayoutProps or PageProps) from './$types'.
// Allows keeping the true type to prevent unexpected changes,
// and to smoothly track dependencies relying on this type.

// For example try change this and build project
export type GLOBAL_LAYER_SETTINGS = {
